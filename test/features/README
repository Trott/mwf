These are the messy notes I took while putting together the Cucumber tests.

I'll clean them up after I figure out what is actually needed and what isn't.

PREREQUISITES

* Add Cucumber to your Ruby environment:

    gem install cucumber

* Add RSpec to your Ruby environment:

    gem install rspec

* Add Capybara and mechanize:

    gem install capybara
    gem install mechanize  (not needed?)
    gem install capybara-mechanize (not needed?)

If that doesn't do it, try doing these too:

* Add Selenium Webdriver to your Ruby environment:

    gem install selenium-webdriver

  If you get an error indicating that you need to update RubyGems, do this:

    gem update --system

* To get rid of irksome JSON warning message when running RSpec:

    gem install json

****

* To test in iPhone simulator:

  You must have XCode 4.2 or later
  svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ selenium-read-only
  open selenium-read-only/iphone/iWebDriver.xcodeproj/
  Using dropdown menu in top left, select "iWebDriver" and "iPhone 5.0 Simulator"
  Build and Run
